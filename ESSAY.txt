1. In this assignment, we didn't ask you to support phrasal queries, which is a
feature that is typically supported in web search engines. Describe how you would support phrasal search in conjunction
with the VSM model. A sketch of the algorithm is sufficient.


Answer.
We can utilize the similar methods for phrase queries as in boolean retrieval.

One of the methods can be bi-word indexing. We can generate the posting lists for both single words and bi-word phrases,
and calculate the weights for each of them in every document. But this will definitely cost more time and space.
And it will cost more if we want to handle phrases more than 2 words.


2. Describe how your search engine reacts to long documents and long queries as compared to short documents and queries.
 Is the normalization you use sufficient to address the problems (see Section 6.4.4 for a hint)? In your judgement,
 is the Itc.Inc scheme (n.b., not the ranking scheme you were asked to implement) sufficient for retrieving documents
 from the Reuters-21578 collection?


Answer.
I found the relevance of searching results of short queries is higher. When searching contains less words, the chances
 are higher that every words appears at least once in the result doc. However, for long queries, many of the words in
 the queries do not appear in the resulting docs.

A better normalization might help to resolve this problem. According to 6.4.4, the normalization by Euclidean distance
 might hide some information for documents with different length.

I think both Itc.Inc and Inc.Itc are sufficient for this collection. What we want to find is just the relative ranking
of similarities of each doc with the query. Since every document is evaluated under the same scheme, and both Scheme are
logically correct, there will not be much differences in the relative rankings.






3. Do you think zone or field parametric indices would be useful for practical search in the Reuters collection?
Note: the Reuters collection does have metadata for each article but the quality of the metadata is not uniform,
nor are the metadata classifications uniformly applied (some documents have it, some don't).


Answer.
They will be useful. For example, we can make use of the titles of each documents to make the searching easier and
more precise.
